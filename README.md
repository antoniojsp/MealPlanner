## Description

This is a tool for planning communal meals.

Each "Mealplan" consists of Days which will be planned for, and each day consists of Meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, etc).

Each Meal is made up of Dishes to be served, and Cooks that will make the dishes.

The MealPlanner app is designed for users who might need to plan for a trip, or to plan for division of labor in a communal housing situation.

## Usage

Users can create a MealPlan, in which they can add Days to plan for, Meals inside those days, and assigns Dishes and Cooks to each meal.

Once a MealPlan is created, users can also modify the MealPlan, or delete it.
