File data_mongo.py added. It is a revision from the entry.py and helpers.py. This new version use exclusively mongodb, eliminating the need to use classes. It is easier to use for now but may get more complicated as more details are added (cooks, recipes).

Added: Preview_structure.png - How one day record in mongo looks like.

- 10-13-20:

I manage to put all the folders structures as we wanted after studying an example code. I deleted the __init__.py and route.py while copying the whole code from route.py to app.py. I changed the flask variable from mealPlannerApp to app. In line 26 in app.py, I found "# mealPlanner.config["TEXT_IMPORT"] = "./static/uploads", which I guess it was used for project1 and I don't what is its function, so I commented it out.
I moved the "app = Flask(__name__)" (line 10) from the old __ini__.py and changed "app.run(debug=True)" in line 98 from mealPlanner to app. I left the folder Database and its files since they are needed to test the current state of the program. Tested in Windows, Mac and Ubuntu.

* the program have to installed mongodb (different than pymongo).  https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

To run it (with the droping list, for now) you need to:
  - Go to the top folder and run recipe_database.py and cook_database.py that are in the Databse folder (to add test data to be displayed in the drop lists).
  - Go to mealplannerapp folder and run "flask run" and see the result on the browser.
