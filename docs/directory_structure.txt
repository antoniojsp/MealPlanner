# Directory Structure

The application repository is currently organized as follows:

Database: This directory contains the Cook and Dish classes, and anything that
they need for them to exist in the MongoDB database.

mealPlannerApp: This is the main directory of the application, which contains
the app.py file for flask, as well as the MealPlanner, Day, and Meal classes in
the entry.py file. There is also the requirements.txt file to be installed with
pip/pip3 for the program to be able to run, and the templates and css directories
that generate the webpages that the user sees.
