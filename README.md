## Description

This is a tool for planning communal meals. The application was designed built with communal housing and hiking trips in mind.

With the app, the user can create "meal plans," with which they can plan meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Snacks, Dinner) for any number of days they want.

The current functionality of the application allows users to create "dishes" and cook profiles, which can then be set to each meal.

Our application is hosted on Heroku, and can be accessed by going to https://meal-planner-app1.herokuapp.com/
