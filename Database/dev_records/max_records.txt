This file is currently serving as a placeholder, and it might get moved to
the Repository Wiki.

This file contains some work records that explain what I have been doing and
what my plans are as time goes by. While currently, these are my personal
records, we could either merge all of ours later on, or scrap these in the end,
if my fellow developers decide that they do not feel comfortable sharing their
work process.

# First half week: Oct 28 to Nov 1, 2020:

The first days, we met to decide the structure of our program. I was to write
the function (or functions) that would allow menu items to be inputed into a
Meal. However, Antonio realized that for the app to be functional, we would need
to store all the information in a Database.

After this, I decided to leave that for the time being, and instead would look
into databases, particularly how to work with MongoDB.
