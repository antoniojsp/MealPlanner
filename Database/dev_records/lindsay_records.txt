Week 1: Following our first meeting on Wednesday 10/28, our team started work on backend; Antonio on user creation of a Mealplan, me on adding Cooks to Meals, and Maxine on adding Dishes to Meals. 

I made a Cook class (and a User class for later use, although for our first prototype we're not worrying about multiple users) and started on some functions to add and remove Cooks from Meals. My work was modeled on Antonio's work with the Day and Meal classes and related functions and methods. 

However, once I started thinking about adding/removing Cooks to Meals, I got confused about data persistence. Discussions on Slack confirmed that Antonio is also wresting with this issue.

We added Bria to our team and met again on Friday 10/30. We're probably going to go with encoding our information as JSON objects and then storing them in MongoDB, since that's what Antonio is most familiar with.

Antonio will look more into database structure, with Max to help. Bria will be mostly responsible for Flask stuff. We'll probably post on Heroku, since that's what Bria and I are both familiar with and we both found it easy on our last project. Max, Antonio, and I will contiue to work on our backend goals aiming for having them drafted in the coming week. I'll be responsible for front-end stuff (html, css), but this isn't a priority yet.

Over the weekend I felt stuck on the backend until we figure out how we're storing and access persistent data, so I started working through the awesome tutorials that Antonio recommended: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database

I also made base.html and index.html (the idea for base.html comes from the above tutorial), put them in a templates directory, and figured out how to push just those items to our main branch. I also made a virtual environment on my machine that should come in handy when we host on Heroku.
