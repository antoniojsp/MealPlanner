10/30/20 Notes

data persistence (MongoDB, JSON?)
hosting/server (Flask, Heroku)
backend
front end layout (html, css, javascript (Jinja))


Antonio: continue with backend
Lindsay: front end, continue with backend
Maxine: continue with backend
Bria: Flask

For the next week:
Antonio: learn about MongoDB, JSON, etc. and how to integrate with backend, with help from Maxine
Lindsay and Maxine: continue to flesh out backend, classes
Bria: get /something/ running on a server - Once a webpage is up, Lindsay start tricking it out

For now, let's not worry about multiple users (passwords, login, etc.) - just do the website for one person for now
