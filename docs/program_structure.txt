# Program Structure

The MealPlanner program is structured in the following way:

The master structure is a MealPlanner.

	Each Mealplanner has a list of Days.

		Each Day has a list of Meals.

			Each Meal has two lists: A list of Cooks, and a list of Dishes.

				A Cook is a person, identified by name,

				A Dish consists of a list of ingredients, quantities, and its recipe.

MealPlanner, Day, Meal, Cook, and Dish are all objects.
